## The Most Restrictive License: SUPERLICENSE
The Superlicense is a non-free software license, when you just do not want clones over your software.

The license code is as follows:

> (CopyrightOwner) ©️ (YYYY) is considered to be the writer of this code all under the Superlicense.
>
> All rights reversed. No part of this software may be forked, transmitted, or copied, by photography,
> with code websites such as GitHub, or by a machine, except with written permission.
>
> Please refer to tyler887.github.io/Superlicense for more information.

## FAQ
### Will the Superlicense be removed from my work?
Yes. When you are around 70 years, your Superlicense works will no longer be trademarked and will enter the public domain, allowing anyone to steal your content freely, all without asking permission.
### Is the Superlicense reccomended for governments?
No. Works made by a government are meant to be in the public domain, except for their logos (they may be trademarks).
### Can I use the Superlicense on images, videos and music?
Yes, as long as the work also has the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 or newer. Note that this license is not permitted on Wikimedia Commons!
### What does "All Rights Reversed" mean?
All rights revered is "Trademark" for short. It bans usage except with permission.
### Are "trademarks" banned from copying in some countries?
Yes. To avoid this, the Superlicense was created as the worldwide "all rights reversed".
### Can I mark my software using Superlicense logos?
Unfortunately, we do not have any logo. For now, you can use this quotation to let users know:
> This software is licensed under [the Superlicense](https://tyler887.github.io/Superlicense/licensetext.txt). All rights reserved. ©️ (YYYY) (name of copyright holder).

You may also download and freely use [the All Rights Reserved badge](https://ebooksuccess4free.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/2000px-license_icon-copyright-88x31-svg.png) linking to the license text.
### What is "Piracy"?
Piracy means violations of the "All Rights Reserved" laws. Piracy can only apply on software that is All Rights Reserved.

Piracy is a serious crime, so it is recommended by law that you program a piracy warning that appears on stolen versions of the content. The Superlicense bans removing this if supplied on the original version. We reccomend the following warning for pirates:

## FAQ
### Will the Superlicense be removed from my work?
Yes. When you are around 70 years, your Superlicense works will no longer be trademarked and will enter the public domain, allowing anyone to steal your content freely, all without asking permission.
### Is the Superlicense reccomended for governments?
No. Works made by a government are meant to be in the public domain, except for their logos (they may be trademarks).
### Can I use the Superlicense on images, videos and music?
Yes, as long as the work also has the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 or newer. Note that this license is not permitted on Wikimedia Commons!
### What does "All Rights Reversed" mean?
All rights revered is "Trademark" for short. It bans usage except with permission.
### Are "trademarks" banned from copying in some countries?
Yes. To avoid this, the Superlicense was created as the worldwide "all rights reversed".
